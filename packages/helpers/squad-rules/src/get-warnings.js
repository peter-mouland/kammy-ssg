//      You will need to fix this by the next deadline
// - Oops! This player is marked as new but has already been selected by another manager in a pending transfer.
//      Please submit but check with your friendly admins
// - Be warned! If you win this new player, you may be putting him into your team in the wrong position (thatâ€™s bad)

// todo : LOAN END
// - The deadline to end loan deals is 24 hours before the weekly transfer deadline.
//      If you end the loan now, this will not take effect until game week commencing {date}
// - This Loan End appears to make your team exceed the limit of two per club.
//      You will need to transfer out or trade a player from that club in order to successfully end this loan deal
// - A player you have selected is not currently on loan.
//      Please ensure you have the correct details, including transaction type.
// - This Loan End appears to put a player into your team in the wrong position.
//      You may need to fix this with your weekly transfers.
